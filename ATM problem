End-to-End Real-Time ATM Cash Availability Prediction System

⸻

Introduction

The goal is to build a real-time ATM cash availability prediction system that allows users to check the denominations (Rs. 2000, Rs. 500, Rs. 100) available at nearby ATMs based on their location. The system predicts how much cash is available in each denomination at any given time (hourly predictions), using historical transaction data and ATM refill data.

Key Objectives:
	1.	Predict total cash available at nearby ATMs.
	2.	Predict denomination breakdown (Rs. 2000, Rs. 500, Rs. 100).
	3.	Predict the probability of cash availability (i.e., the ATM might be empty).
	4.	Provide real-time predictions based on user location.

Why Real-Time?
	•	Users want to know if they can withdraw money from an ATM and if the denominations they need (like Rs. 500 or Rs. 2000) are available at the ATM they plan to visit. By providing live updates, the system can guide users to the nearest ATMs with the cash they need.

Phases of Development

⸻

1. Data Collection

To train a machine learning model to predict ATM cash availability, we need a rich dataset containing historical ATM transaction and refill data.

Data Required:
	•	ATM transaction logs: Withdrawals, amounts withdrawn, time of transactions.
	•	ATM refill data: Amount and denominations of cash refilled.
	•	ATM geographical data: Latitude, longitude, and location.
	•	ATM operational data: Information on when each ATM was last refilled and when it is expected to be refilled.



⸻

2. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be fed into a machine learning model. The goal is to create features that help the model understand patterns and predict the ATM cash status.

Time-based features:
	•	hour: Hour of the day (e.g., 10:00 AM, 4:00 PM).
	•	day_of_week: Day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
	•	month: Month of the year (e.g., January, February).

Lag Features:
	•	withdrawal_last_1hr: Total cash withdrawn from the ATM in the last 1 hour.
	•	withdrawal_last_3hr_sum: Total cash withdrawn from the ATM in the last 3 hours.
	•	cash_loaded_last_24hr: Cash refilled in the last 24 hours.

Denomination Features:
	•	denom_2000_last_1hr: Total Rs. 2000 notes withdrawn in the last 1 hour.
	•	denom_500_last_1hr: Total Rs. 500 notes withdrawn in the last 1 hour.
	•	denom_100_last_1hr: Total Rs. 100 notes withdrawn in the last 1 hour.

Geospatial Features:
	•	distance_from_user: Distance from the user’s current location to the ATM (calculated using the Haversine formula).

Time Since Last Refill:
	•	time_since_last_refill: How long ago the ATM was last refilled (in hours).

⸻

3. Geospatial Filtering (Haversine)

To find nearby ATMs, we need to calculate the distance between the user’s location and each ATM. This is done using the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points (latitude, longitude).

Haversine Formula:

a = \sin^2\left(\frac{lat_2 - lat_1}{2}\right) + \cos(lat_1) \cdot \cos(lat_2) \cdot \sin^2\left(\frac{lon_2 - lon_1}{2}\right)
c = 2 \cdot \text{atan2}\left(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1 - a}\right)
distance = R \cdot c

Where:
	•	lat_1, lon_1 = User’s location.
	•	lat_2, lon_2 = ATM location.
	•	R = Earth’s radius (mean = 6371 km).

We can filter ATMs within a 1 to 50 km radius based on the distance calculated using the Haversine formula.

⸻

4. AI Model Selection

For this task, XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is selected as the best model because it works well with structured/tabular data, can handle both regression (predicting cash amounts) and classification (probability of availability), and is highly efficient.
	•	XGBoost Regressor: Predicts cash amounts in each denomination (Rs. 2000, Rs. 500, Rs. 100).
	•	XGBoost Classifier (optional): Predicts the probability that an ATM will have cash available (binary classification).

Why XGBoost?
	•	Performance: Efficient handling of large datasets.
	•	Accuracy: Captures non-linear relationships between features.
	•	Interpretability: Provides feature importance scores.

Model Training:

We will train separate models for each denomination (Rs. 2000, Rs. 500, Rs. 100). The models will be trained on historical data using features like time of day, withdrawal patterns, denomination breakdowns, and ATM refill data.

⸻

5. Backend API (Flask)

The Backend will be built using Flask (a lightweight web framework in Python) to handle API requests and serve real-time predictions.

Steps:
	1.	The user provides their latitude and longitude via an HTTP request.
	2.	The backend filters nearby ATMs using the Haversine formula (geospatial filtering).
	3.	The backend fetches the most recent ATM data (withdrawals, refills) and uses the trained XGBoost models to predict the available cash in each denomination.
	4.	The predictions are sent back to the user.



⸻

6. Frontend (User Interface)

To display live data, we can build a web interface (using React.js or Vue.js) or a mobile app (using React Native or Flutter). The frontend will interact with the backend to fetch ATM predictions.

Live Data Flow:
	1.	User Inputs Location: The user enters their location (latitude, longitude).
	2.	API Request: The frontend sends a request to the backend API.
	3.	API Response: The backend returns predictions of cash availability at nearby ATMs.
	4.	Real-Time Updates: The frontend periodically checks for new updates (e.g., every 5 minutes) to keep data current.

⸻

7. Deployment & Real-Time Updates

To ensure live updates:
	•	Use WebSocket or Polling for real-time communication between frontend and backend.
	•	Deploy your backend API on cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku.
	•	Use cloud databases (e.g., AWS RDS) for storing ATM data and ensuring live data fetching.

	4.	Feature Importance: Provides insight into which features (e.g., time, last refill) affect predictions most.
	5.	Scalable: Can be deployed at scale across thousands of ATMs with consistent performance.

⸻

Cons
	1.	Not Real-Time Learning: It doesn’t learn from new data continuously; retraining is needed periodically.
	2.	Needs Historical Data: Accuracy depends on the quality and volume of past transaction/refill data.
	3.	Model Complexity: Slightly harder to interpret than linear regression or rule-based systems.

🧾 Problem Statement

In many regions, users often travel to nearby ATMs expecting to withdraw cash, only to discover that the ATM is either out of service, lacks sufficient funds, or does not dispense the required denominations. This causes user inconvenience, wasted time, and unnecessary travel, especially in densely populated or cash-dependent areas. There is currently no accurate, real-time system that predicts ATM cash availability and denomination breakdown before the user arrives.

The goal is to build an intelligent, adaptive system that can:
	•	Predict the likelihood of cash availability at nearby ATMs.
	•	Estimate denomination availability (e.g., ₹100, ₹500, ₹2000).
	•	Adapt to location, time, and user withdrawal patterns using AI/ML models.

Users currently have no way of knowing the probability of cash and denomination availability in nearby ATMs within a given time frame. Without predictive insights, they are unable to determine whether an ATM will still have their required amount and denominations (e.g., ₹100, ₹500) by the time they arrive — leading to uncertainty, wasted travel, and poor user experience.

While some existing systems may indicate whether an ATM has money or is operational, they do not provide predictive forecasting of how likely it is that the required amount and denominations will remain available at the user’s expected arrival time.

💡 What Makes This Invention Unique

This invention uniquely combines real-time geolocation, AI-based regression modeling (e.g., XGBoost), and spatial search (Ball Tree algorithm) to not only identify nearby ATMs, but also to predict the probability of cash and specific denomination availability at a future time (e.g., 30–45 minutes ahead). Unlike existing solutions that merely indicate if an ATM is operational or has cash, this system provides a forecast—enabling users to make informed decisions before visiting an ATM. It transforms reactive ATM discovery into a proactive, intelligent experience, minimizing failed visits and optimizing convenience.

🔍 Non-Obvious Aspects of the Invention
	1.	Forecasting Cash & Denomination Availability Using AI
Unlike simple status-check systems, this invention uses regression models (e.g., XGBoost) to predict future cash and denomination availability based on time, location, usage patterns, and ATM refill history.
	2.	Time-Sensitive Probability Scoring
It uniquely calculates the probability of availability for a specific future time window (e.g., 30–45 minutes ahead), rather than just providing static, current ATM status.
	3.	Integration of Ball Tree for Geospatial Filtering
The use of a Ball Tree algorithm to efficiently identify nearby ATMs from the user’s live GPS location is an intelligent, performance-optimized spatial filtering method—especially suitable for real-time use on mobile devices.
	4.	User-Centric Denomination Matching Logic
Most ATM solutions focus only on cash presence; this system adds the ability to match user-specific denomination requests (e.g., ₹500 only), which is often overlooked in other systems.
	5.	Layered Architecture for Live + Predictive Insights
The design intelligently integrates real-time data (from servers or ATM feeds) with historical trends to deliver live plus forecasted results, a non-trivial combination requiring layered computation.
