1. Agenda
	•	Discuss current testing practices and future improvements
	•	Explore Copilot usage in testing workflows
	•	Identify cross-functional opportunities for testers
	•	Evaluate DB testing tools for the team
	•	Plan for an adaptable end-to-end testing framework
	•	Consider utilities for auto-generating feature files in Cucumber

⸻

2. Discussion Points
	•	Testing Practices & Copilot
	•	How the team is currently performing testing
	•	Ways to utilize Copilot for automation, script generation, and faster test design
	•	Need to make Copilot usage simple and accessible to all testers
	•	Cross-Functional Knowledge Sharing
	•	Encourage testers to learn about each other’s tools and areas (functional, automation, DB testing, etc.)
	•	Build a culture of knowledge-sharing across teams
	•	DB Testing Tools
	•	Requirement for easy-to-use Database testing tools for validation and query execution
	•	Suggestion to evaluate tools (like DbVisualizer, DBeaver, or in-house utility)
	•	End-to-End Testing Framework
	•	Need for a framework that is simple, scalable, and adaptable across teams
	•	Should support functional, API, DB, and automation testing
	•	Feature File Generation (Cucumber)
	•	Discussion on utilities or tools that can auto-generate feature files
	•	Potential to integrate with Copilot or custom utility for faster BDD adoption

3. Decisions Taken
	•	Copilot will be explored as a common assistant for test design and scripting.
	•	Team will identify 1–2 DB testing tools for pilot usage.
	•	Plan to design an E2E adaptable testing framework (functional + automation + DB).
	•	Look into utilities for Cucumber feature file generation.
