Got it üëç Since you‚Äôre presenting this to leadership, the agenda needs to be sharp, structured, and impactful. Here‚Äôs a catchy ‚ÄúWhat, Why, Who, How, and Benefits‚Äù agenda in bullet style for your Next-Gen Automation Framework presentation:

‚∏ª

Agenda: Next-Gen Automation Framework ‚Äì Reliable, Scalable, and Insight-Driven

1. What are we building?
	‚Ä¢	Unified automation framework for Web & Desktop
	‚Ä¢	Selenium for web applications, Sikuli for desktop
	‚Ä¢	Powered by TestNG + Page Object Model for structure & maintainability
	‚Ä¢	Built-in Self-Healing (Healenium) to reduce script failures
	‚Ä¢	Dual Reporting ‚Üí Allure + Extent Reports for deep insights
	‚Ä¢	Litmus Integration for unattended execution
	‚Ä¢	Octane Integration for execution tracking & report sync

‚∏ª

2. Why do we need this?
	‚Ä¢	Current frameworks lack scalability & flexibility across platforms
	‚Ä¢	Reduce manual intervention and flaky test failures
	‚Ä¢	Ensure faster feedback loops with continuous reporting
	‚Ä¢	Enable seamless CI/CD pipeline execution
	‚Ä¢	Drive quality at speed aligned with enterprise goals

‚∏ª

3. Who benefits?
	‚Ä¢	Testers ‚Üí Simplified adoption, less maintenance overhead
	‚Ä¢	Developers ‚Üí Quick feedback on code quality
	‚Ä¢	Leadership & Managers ‚Üí Real-time execution insights in Octane
	‚Ä¢	Business & Stakeholders ‚Üí Reliable automation coverage ensuring faster releases

‚∏ª

4. How are we different?
	‚Ä¢	One framework handling Web + Desktop apps seamlessly
	‚Ä¢	Self-healing tests ‚Üí Reduced maintenance cost
	‚Ä¢	End-to-end traceability with Octane reporting
	‚Ä¢	Unattended execution ‚Üí Saves time & resources
	‚Ä¢	Scalable & Future-ready to plug into new tools and tech

‚∏ª

5. Expected Benefits
	‚Ä¢	40‚Äì50% reduction in script maintenance efforts
	‚Ä¢	Increased automation coverage for both web & desktop
	‚Ä¢	Better decision-making with comprehensive reporting dashboards
	‚Ä¢	Faster time-to-market with stable automation at scale

Limitations with Tosca:
	‚Ä¢	Faced browser extension issues which broke regression cycles
	‚Ä¢	Required workarounds from support, but those were not reliable across all machines
	‚Ä¢	Execution was slower compared to Selenium
	‚Ä¢	Need for speed and reliability: Selenium provides faster execution and stable cross-browser support
	‚Ä¢	Flexibility: Open-source ecosystem allows integration with multiple tools (Sikuli, Allure, Extent, Litmus, Octane) which Tosca limits
	‚Ä¢	Scalability: Framework can handle Web + Desktop apps seamlessly, which was harder in Tosca
	‚Ä¢	Future-readiness: Easier to adopt new technologies and plugins without vendor dependency

‚∏ª

‚ùå Drawbacks of Tosca compared with Selenium
	1.	Performance ‚Äì Tosca execution is slower, especially for large regression suites
	2.	Browser Dependency ‚Äì Relies heavily on Tosca extensions, prone to breaking when browsers update
	3.	Flexibility Limitations ‚Äì Difficult to integrate with open-source tools (like Allure, Extent, Healenium, etc.)
	4.	Cost ‚Äì Tosca is a licensed tool, adds significant cost compared to Selenium which is open-source
	5.	Customization ‚Äì Tosca has limited customization; Selenium allows deep framework tailoring with Java/TestNG
	6.	Cross-Platform Testing ‚Äì Handling desktop + web apps in one framework is not straightforward in Tosca, but Selenium + Sikuli achieves this
	7.	Vendor Dependency ‚Äì Need to rely on Tosca support for fixes and updates, whereas Selenium community provides faster solutions



üëâ This agenda flows naturally from What ‚Üí Why ‚Üí Who ‚Üí How ‚Üí Benefits, keeping it leadership-friendly while showing value, efficiency, and scalability.

Do you want me to also make a 1-slide version of this agenda (visually catchy for leadership), so it‚Äôs easy to present without too many words?
