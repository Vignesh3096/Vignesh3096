ðŸ”¹ Usage of Playwright over Selenium
	1.	Cross-browser automation â€“ Supports Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (Safari engine) with a single API.
	2.	Auto-waiting â€“ No need for explicit waits in most cases; Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready.
	3.	Modern language support â€“ Works with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.
	4.	Parallel execution â€“ Built-in test runner (@playwright/test) supports sharding, retries, parallel execution.
	5.	Network interception â€“ Can mock, modify, or block network requests easily.
	6.	API testing â€“ In addition to UI, Playwright can perform REST/GraphQL API testing.
	7.	Mobile and device emulation â€“ Provides native device emulation (geolocation, permissions, viewport).
	8.	Headless & headed execution â€“ Runs fast in headless but allows debugging in headed mode.
	9.	Browser context isolation â€“ Supports multiple isolated sessions within a single browser instance (great for multi-user testing).
	10.	Visual & screenshot testing â€“ Built-in screenshot and video recording for debugging.

ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Playwright over Selenium
	1.	Faster execution â€“ Optimized for speed; avoids heavy Selenium Grid setup.
	2.	Less flaky tests â€“ Auto-waiting and event-driven model reduce test failures due to timing issues.
	3.	Simpler setup â€“ No need to manage browser drivers; Playwright installs browsers automatically.
	4.	All-in-one tool â€“ Handles UI + API + visual testing in one framework.
	5.	Better debugging â€“ Trace viewer and detailed error reporting make troubleshooting easy.
	6.	Future-ready â€“ Actively developed by Microsoft; built for modern web apps (SPA, React, Angular, Vue).
	7.	Cross-platform CI/CD friendly â€“ Works well with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps without extra config.
	8.	Supports modern web features â€“ Shadow DOM, iframes, file uploads, downloads, and WebSockets are easier to handle.
	9.	Scalable testing â€“ Built-in parallelization means faster regression runs compared to Selenium.
	10.	Lower maintenance cost â€“ Stable APIs and reduced flakiness mean less time fixing broken tests.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
	â€¢	Selenium = Mature, widely adopted, good for legacy systems.
	â€¢	Playwright = Faster, modern, less flaky, and better suited for todayâ€™s dynamic web apps.

Would you like me to create a side-by-side comparison table (Selenium vs Playwright) so you can directly drop it into a presentation?
