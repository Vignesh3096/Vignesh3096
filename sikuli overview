SikuliX is a powerful automation tool that uses image recognition to automate graphical user interface (GUI) interactions. It allows users to automate anything they see on the screen of their computer, including desktop applications and web pages. SikuliX is built on top of OpenCV and other image processing libraries and supports multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, and Ruby. Here's a detailed documentation on SikuliX:

## Overview

SikuliX provides a way to interact with elements on the screen using screenshots. You can create scripts to perform tasks like clicking buttons, entering text, and verifying the presence of images. This is especially useful for automating applications that do not have a standard API for automation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: SikuliX requires Java 8 or later. You can download the latest JRE from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **SikuliX Setup**: The setup process involves downloading the SikuliX setup jar file.

### Steps to Install

1. **Download SikuliX Setup**: Visit the [SikuliX GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1/releases) and download the latest setup jar file (e.g., `sikulixsetup-2.0.5.jar`).

2. **Run the Setup Jar**:
   ```sh
   java -jar sikulixsetup-2.0.5.jar
   ```
   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. The setup process will download additional dependencies and create executable files for SikuliX.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sh
   sikulix
   ```
   Running the above command should open the SikuliX IDE, indicating that the installation was successful.

## SikuliX IDE

The SikuliX IDE is a graphical environment where you can create and edit automation scripts. It provides features like image capture, script editor, and script execution.

### Key Features

- **Image Capture**: Allows you to capture screenshots of elements you want to interact with.
- **Script Editor**: Supports writing scripts in Jython (Python for Java), JavaScript, and Ruby.
- **Script Execution**: Run and debug scripts directly from the IDE.

## Basic Concepts

### Regions

A Region is a rectangular area on the screen. You can define a region to limit the scope of image searches and interactions.

```python
from sikuli import *

# Define a region
region = Region(0, 0, 800, 600)
```

### Images

Images are the core of SikuliX automation. You capture screenshots of elements and use them to find and interact with these elements in your scripts.

```python
# Capture an image
image = capture(region)
```

### Actions

SikuliX provides a range of actions to interact with elements on the screen, such as click, double-click, type, drag, and drop.

```python
# Click on an image
click("button.png")

# Type text into an input field
type("input.png", "Hello, SikuliX!")
```

## Advanced Features

### Pattern Matching

SikuliX uses pattern matching to find elements on the screen. You can adjust the similarity threshold to control how closely the found image must match the reference image.

```python
# Set similarity threshold
pattern = Pattern("button.png").similar(0.9)
click(pattern)
```

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

SikuliX includes OCR capabilities to read text from the screen. This can be useful for validating text content.

```python
# Read text from a region
text = region.text()
print(text)
```

### Scripting Languages

SikuliX supports multiple scripting languages, including:

- **Jython**: Python for Java
- **JavaScript**: Using the Rhino engine
- **JRuby**: Ruby for Java

Scripts can be written in any of these languages, providing flexibility based on user preference.

## Examples

### Example 1: Click a Button

```python
from sikuli import *

# Click on a button
click("button.png")
```

### Example 2: Login Automation

```python
from sikuli import *

# Open browser and navigate to login page
click("browser_icon.png")
wait("url_bar.png")
type("url_bar.png", "https://example.com/login\n")

# Enter username and password
wait("username_field.png")
type("username_field.png", "my_username")
type("password_field.png", "my_password")

# Click login button
click("login_button.png")
```

### Example 3: Verify Text Presence

```python
from sikuli import *

# Capture text from a region
region = Region(100, 100, 200, 50)
text = region.text()

# Verify text content
if "Welcome" in text:
    print("Login successful")
else:
    print("Login failed")
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **High-Quality Screenshots**: Use clear and high-quality screenshots for better accuracy in image recognition.
2. **Stable Regions**: Define stable regions to limit the search area and improve performance.
3. **Exception Handling**: Include exception handling in your scripts to manage unexpected situations.

```python
try:
    click("button.png")
except FindFailed:
    print("Button not found!")
```

4. **Modular Scripts**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions for better maintainability.
