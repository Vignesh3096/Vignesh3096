Playwright is often considered better than Selenium for modern web automation due to its performance, reliability, and ease of use. Here’s why Playwright is superior in many cases:


1. Speed & Performance

✅ Faster Execution – Playwright uses WebSockets instead of Selenium’s HTTP-based WebDriver, leading to significantly faster test execution.
✅ Native Headless Mode – Designed for efficient headless execution, reducing resource consumption.
✅ Better Parallel Execution – Playwright’s built-in parallel execution is faster than Selenium Grid, which requires additional setup.

2. Stability & Reliability

✅ Auto-Waiting Mechanism – Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready before interacting with them, reducing flaky tests.
✅ Resilient Against Dynamic Content – Handles dynamic elements better by retrying failed actions.
✅ Better Frame & Tab Management – Playwright natively supports multiple tabs, iframes, and pop-ups, which are harder to manage in Selenium.

3. Modern Features

✅ Network Interception & Mocking – Playwright can intercept API requests, mock responses, and simulate network conditions, which is complex in Selenium.
✅ Built-in Debugging Tools – Includes a trace viewer, video recording, and screenshot capture, making debugging much easier.
✅ Web Component & Shadow DOM Support – Works seamlessly with modern shadow DOM elements, which are challenging in Selenium.

4. Mobile & Cross-Browser Testing

✅ Native Mobile Emulation – Unlike Selenium, Playwright allows testing on mobile devices without real emulators.
✅ Supports More Browsers – Works with Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (Safari engine), and Edge, while Selenium struggles with WebKit.

5. Simpler Setup & Integration

✅ No Need for a Separate WebDriver – Playwright does not require a browser driver (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver) like Selenium, simplifying setup.
✅ Better Integration with CI/CD – Faster execution and parallelism make it more efficient for Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.

When is Selenium Still Better?
	•	Legacy Support – Works better with older browsers and applications.
	•	Larger Community – More resources, libraries, and support due to its long history.
	•	Broader Language Support – Selenium supports Java, Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript, whereas Playwright primarily supports JavaScript, Python, C#, and Java.


Final Verdict

✅ If you want faster, more reliable, and modern web automation, Playwright is the better choice.
✅ If you need legacy support or a well-established tool with a large ecosystem, Selenium is still relevant.

Playwright is a modern, open-source automation tool for end-to-end testing of web applications. Developed by Microsoft, it provides a single API to automate multiple browsers—including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit—making it ideal for cross-browser testing. Key features include:
	•	Fast Execution: Uses WebSocket-based communication for quicker interactions.
	•	Built-In Auto-Waiting: Automatically waits for elements to be ready, reducing flaky tests.
	•	Advanced Debugging: Offers tools like a trace viewer and video recording to help diagnose issues.
	•	Network Interception: Allows you to intercept, modify, and mock network requests.
	•	Mobile Emulation & Parallel Execution: Simplifies testing on mobile devices and speeds up tests by running them in parallel.

This makes Playwright a powerful alternative to traditional tools like Selenium, especially for testing modern web applications efficiently.
