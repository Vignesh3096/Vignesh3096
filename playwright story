✅ Success Story: Enhancing Test Automation Efficiency and Reliability Through Tool Migration

Project Objective:
To enhance the efficiency, reliability, and execution speed of the automated test suite for a complex web application by optimizing the existing Selenium-based framework and evaluating new-age automation tools.

Background:
Our team was responsible for maintaining the regression automation suite for a large-scale web application. We used Selenium with Java, TestNG, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. While the framework was robust, over time, it became evident that test execution times were increasing, and flakiness was affecting reliability.

Challenges Faced:
	•	Increased execution time during regression cycles, impacting release velocity.
	•	Flaky tests due to dynamic web elements and synchronization issues.
	•	Limited scalability and maintainability of the existing Selenium framework.

Initiatives & Solutions:
	•	Conducted a root cause analysis to identify bottlenecks in test execution.
	•	Optimized the existing TestNG-Selenium-POM framework by introducing better waits, reusable components, and parallel test execution.
	•	Proposed and initiated a Proof of Concept (PoC) using Playwright, a modern automation framework known for faster execution and built-in auto-wait capabilities.
	•	Created a comparison report between Selenium and Playwright, highlighting performance improvements and stability gains.
	•	Collaborated with stakeholders and development teams to validate test coverage and adapt scripts for the new tool.

Results & Impact:
	•	Reduced end-to-end regression execution time by ~40% with Playwright compared to Selenium.
	•	Improved test reliability and stability, reducing flaky test cases significantly.
	•	Enabled faster feedback loops for developers during CI/CD pipelines.
	•	Set the foundation for tool migration, boosting long-term maintainability and scalability.

Recognition:
	•	The initiative was well-received by leadership for its proactive approach and long-term vision.
	•	Appreciated by the QA and DevOps teams for reducing test overhead and improving release quality.
