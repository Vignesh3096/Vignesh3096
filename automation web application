Generate a complete end-to-end project that helps a team select the best test automation tool based on multiple criteria. The project should include:

1. Folder and file structure:
   - project-root/
     - index.html
     - style.css
     - script.js
     - data/
         - tools.xlsx
     - utils/
         - excelReader.js

2. index.html:
   - Responsive HTML page
   - Multiple questions with options (like a quiz form)
   - A submit button that calculates the best test automation tool based on selected options
   - Area to display the result

3. style.css:
   - Clean and modern UI
   - Highlight selected options

4. script.js:
   - Load data from Excel (via excelReader.js)
   - Generate questions dynamically from Excel
   - Handle user selections
   - Calculate the best tool based on permutations and combinations
   - Display the result dynamically

5. utils/excelReader.js:
   - Read Excel file (tools.xlsx) using JavaScript (preferably using SheetJS or similar library)
   - Provide data in JSON format for script.js

6. Excel structure (tools.xlsx):
   - Columns: Question, Option, Mapping Tool(s), Condition(s)
   - Each row represents one option and which tools it maps to

7. Bonus:
   - Include error handling if no tool matches
   - Highlight top 2 tools if there are multiple matches
   - Make it easy to extend questions or tools by updating Excel only

Provide **all the code** for each file and explain where to place them. Make it fully ready to run in a browser locally. Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) and minimal dependencies.
