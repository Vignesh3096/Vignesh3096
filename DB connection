Hi [Team],

I’m working on automating drill-through validation from EPM using backend DB queries. Could you please share the following information:
	1.	Database connection details:
	•	DB type (e.g., SQL Server/HANA)
	•	Host/IP
	•	Port
	•	DB name
	•	Read-only credentials (if available)
	2.	Cube/Table Details:
	•	Technical name of InfoProvider/model
	•	Underlying DB table/view storing the data
	•	List of key fields: ACCOUNT, FISCAL_PERIOD, AMOUNT, etc.
	3.	Access:
	•	Can I get read-only access to query it?
	•	Or can you provide a SQL view or query for this data?

Thanks in advance!
