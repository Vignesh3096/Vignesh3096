The hybrid automation framework integrates Selenium and Sikuli to support both web and desktop application testing within a single setup. Selenium handles web-based elements, while Sikuli takes care of image-based or desktop interactions, ensuring broader test coverage. It supports parallel and distributed execution to reduce test cycle time, which is especially useful in CI/CD environments. The framework also includes self-healing scripts that automatically adjust to UI changes, improving test stability and reducing maintenance.

For reporting, Allure is integrated to provide visually rich, interactive dashboards with detailed logs, screenshots, and execution timelines. This helps teams identify issues quickly, track progress efficiently, and gain better visibility into overall software quality. The framework is reliable, scalable, and tailored to meet the demands of modern test automation.
