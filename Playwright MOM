Discussion Points
	1.	Testing Approach
	•	Need to check with the Test Team on the current testing process for the application.
	•	Evaluate how the current test cases can be migrated to Playwright.
	2.	Dev Team Support
	•	Need to check with the Dev Team for required access.
	•	Collect additional inputs such as credentials, test data, and environment details to support testing.
