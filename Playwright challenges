Got it üëç
You want the MoM with points 1‚Äì9, but with each topic split into Major Challenges/Observations and Minor Challenges/Observations so the meeting notes clearly highlight impact.

Here‚Äôs a structured draft:

Attendees: [List attendees]
Project: Playwright Framework Evaluation and Enhancements

Discussion Points & Observations

1. Why TypeScript is chosen for Playwright

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Strong typing reduces runtime errors but adds a learning curve for non-TypeScript developers.
	‚Ä¢	Requires additional build step (tsc) compared to JavaScript.

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	IDE support (intellisense, autocomplete) improves productivity.
	‚Ä¢	Aligns with Playwright documentation and community standards.

2. Script execution on Cloud or Containers

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Need Docker setup with correct browsers and dependencies.
	‚Ä¢	Cloud cost and execution time monitoring required.

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Compatible with BrowserStack, SauceLabs, AWS, Azure.
	‚Ä¢	Containerization helps parallel execution in CI/CD.

3. Why Cucumber is not chosen

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Additional complexity with Gherkin ‚Üí step definitions mapping.
	‚Ä¢	Maintenance overhead when application grows.

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Playwright test runner already covers reporting, tagging, and structuring.
	‚Ä¢	Cucumber provides readability but at cost of speed.

4. Converting TDD to BDD for larger audience

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Converting existing TDD tests to BDD requires significant rework.
	‚Ä¢	Non-technical stakeholders prefer business-readable format.

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Can follow hybrid model: TDD internally + BDD-style reporting for managers/business users.

‚∏ª

5. Logger and Tracing Options

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Need to decide on logger framework (e.g., Winston, pino).
	‚Ä¢	Storage and retrieval of logs across CI/CD runs.

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Playwright built-in tracing and video recording help debugging.
	‚Ä¢	Logs can be extended for error-only or debug mode.

‚∏ª

6. Global Test Data Variables

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Synchronizing data across multiple environments (dev, QA, prod).
	‚Ä¢	Risk of test failures if environment variables not updated properly.

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Can maintain .env or globalSetup.ts.
	‚Ä¢	Centralizing data reduces duplication.

‚∏ª

7. Parameterization from Excel (Test Data)

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Need library (exceljs, xlsx) to parse Excel during runtime.
	‚Ä¢	Data validation and formatting in Excel required.

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Enables non-technical users to update test data easily.
	‚Ä¢	Good fit for data-driven testing.

8. Parameterization of Test Case Names from Excel

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Mapping Excel test names to Playwright test definitions dynamically is non-trivial.
	‚Ä¢	Incorrect mapping may skip tests unintentionally.

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Helps business team decide which tests to execute.
	‚Ä¢	Similar to how TestNG allows selective execution.

‚∏ª

9. TestNG XML equivalent for Playwright

Major Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Playwright does not have a native XML suite runner.
	‚Ä¢	Need to build custom configuration utility to mimic TestNG XML (grouping, including/excluding).

Minor Challenges/Observations:
	‚Ä¢	JSON/YAML-based config can be an alternative.
	‚Ä¢	Custom tags (like --grep) in Playwright can partially replace TestNG XML groups.

Action Items
	‚Ä¢	[Owner] Finalize documentation for TypeScript justification.
	‚Ä¢	[Owner] Build Docker/Cloud POC for Playwright execution.
	‚Ä¢	[Owner] Confirm logger framework and integrate with Playwright.
	‚Ä¢	[Owner] Implement global variable management approach.
	‚Ä¢	[Owner] Create Excel utility for test data + test case name parameterization.
	‚Ä¢	[Owner] Explore feasibility of TestNG-XML-like configuration for Playwright.
	‚Ä¢	[Owner] Evaluate hybrid TDD + BDD-style reporting.

üëâ Do you want me to also add recommendations/next steps for each point (like solution proposals), or should the MoM stay strictly at challenges/observations level?
